## pd2jack

...is a shell application for running **Pure Data** patches as minimalist JACK clients, using **LibPd**. I.E., the patches run "headless" and without a GUI. However, parameters can be passed to the patch from the cmd line. See "Passing Parameters" below...

 * This has moved up to an early "beta" version. **pd2jack** has currently been tested only on Linux.

### Features

 - Up to 16 audio ports and/or 16 MIDI ports can be opened per instance. Ports are defined at startup with cmd arguments, not by the Pd patch.
 - Parameters can be passed to the Pd patch from the shell (not interactively, currently).

Example patch "synths.pd" (shown in the *Claudia* patchbay)

![synths.pd pic](resource/pd2j_synths.png)

Above example invoked with (**pd2jack** installed, current dir: *pd2jack/pd* ):

    pd2jack -n Synths -m 3:0 -a 0:3 -s -p synths.pd

The patch is a very simple example of routing by MIDI port/channel offsets.

See the "MIDI ports" section below for an explanation of this patch...

### Startup Options

```
Help: pd2jack <options> -p 'file.pd' <'param strs'>
-p : Pd patch Name, with valid path

 Optional args:
-a : Audio ports (0-16) - default: 2:2 
-h : Help msg 
-m : Midi ports (0-16) - default: 1:1
-n : JACK port Name - default: pd2jack
-s : Silence Pd [print] objects (no args) - default: Not silent
-v : verbosity (0-1) - default: 0

```

**Quit:** CTRL C

## Examples

**Simple: **

    pd2jack -p inout.pd

Open the patch "inout.pd" in the current dir, with the default settings.

**Using all options:**

    pd2jack -p ./pd/rev_ctrl.pd -n MyPatch -s -v 1 -a 2:2 -m 1:0 '1 90' '2 99' '3 0.7'

Open "./pd/rev_ctrl.pd" with:

 - Client name: MyPatch
 - Silence print objects
 - Verbosity level 1 (echo settings)
 - JACK Audio ports: 2 inputs, 2 outputs
 - JACK MIDI ports: 1 input, no outputs
 - Parameter pairs: 3

## Detailed Info
### Audio ports

Audio port data is passed to/from the patch in standard Pd "interleaved" data. It's accessed by the patch with the standard adc~ and dac~ objects, and is routed internally to those conventions.

For instance, four audio *input* ports can be accessed thusly:

    [adc~ 1 2 3 4]

Another option (there are many with 16 ports):

    [adc~ 1 3] [adc~ 2 4]
    
    [dac~ 2 3] [dac~ 1 4]

The patch "A4x4_swap.pd" routes audio inputs 1 & 2 to outputs 3 & 4, and inputs 3 & 4 to outputs 1 & 2 (This example is relatively meaningless, of course, since I/O routing is the speciality of JACK):

![4x4swap pic](resource/ps2j_A4x4_swap.png)

Four audio I/O ports (and no MIDI ports) can be opened by invoking pd2jack thus:

    pd2jack -a 4:4 -m 0:0 -p ./pd/A4x4_swap.pd

NOTE: pd2jack doesn't open JACK ports based on the Pd patch; those are defined on the cmd line.

### MIDI ports

MIDI ports follow the **Pure Data** convention: internal MIDI data is routed to & from external (JACK) ports with "channel offset" values.

The first MIDI **input** port (MidiIn-0) passes data to the patch on the "standard" MIDI channels -- 1-16 (or 0-15 programmatically).

Each additional MIDI port adds an offset of 16. So input port 2 (MidiIn-1) routes data to the patch on channels 17-32, port 3 converts to channels 33-48, etc.

Likewise for MIDI **output**: data output from the patch with the channel offset of +16 (channels 17-32) is sent and output on MIDI output port 2 (MidiOut-1). 

The opening pic and patch (top of this page -- synths.pd) demonstrate these concepts.

**NOTE: These are "virtual" MIDI channels that only Pure Data recognizes internally. This "Channel Offset" approach doesn't work with normal MIDI messages, and is NEVER routed through JACK or ALSA.**

### Note On / Note Off

Incoming JACK MIDI NOTE_OFF msgs are converted to NOTE_ON, Velocity=0, per the Pd convention.

LibPd doesn't even include NOTE_OFF in the api, so no conversion on outgoing data. A NOTE_ON, Velocity=0 *could* be returned to the JACK MIDI port as NOTE_OFF. But it's not happening here, currently. 

Those messages wouldn't be output by Pure Data, anyway. Can't even happen in Pd Vanilla, at least. 

### Pitch Bend Messages

The example patch "inout.pd" illustrates the conversion (within the patch) between incoming bend data (0-16383) to the outgoing (-8182 to 8191) data convention. The objects **bendin** and **bendout** aren't consistent.

This patch also demonstrates the "channel offset" aspect of Pd, as each Pd object is in *Omni* mode if a channel # isn't present. It simply copies MIDI data from the inputs to the outputs, which mirrors the incoming port # to the output port #.

So MIDI data entering on in port 2 will exit on out port 2; likewise 1->1, 2->2, 3->3 ..., etc. *Obviously, the data can be re-routed to another port, in the patch.*

![4x4swap pic](resource/ps2j_inout.png)

From the *midi-help.pd* documentation patch:

```
Known bug: [bendin] and [bendout] are inconsistent. 
While [bendin] outputs values from 0 to 16383, [bendout] takes 
values from -8192 to 8191 - this won't change.
```

The part of "inout.pd" that's *pitchbend* specific:

    [bendin     ]
     |         |
    [- 8192]   |
     |         |
    [bendout    ]

Basically, **pd2jack** *shouldn't* make conversions on outgoing data (it doesn't), if **Pure Data** doesn't.

Hey -- it's Pd...(shrug)

## Passing Parameters

Parameters *can* be passed (from the shell) to the Pd patch with this simple technique - a pair of numbers in the format:

     parameter# parameter_value

Since the separator in the pair is a space, quotes are required. Here's an example of three parameters:

    '1 90' '2 99' '3 0.7'

Any arguments without a preceeding *-option* are assumed to be parameter pairs. If the pair is "unparsable" (two strings, for instance) **LibPd** will either send garbage to the patch, or *possibly* just ignore them. Single-number strings will trigger an error. 

The patch "rev_ctrl.pd" illustrates how these three parameters are received by a Pd patch, via the *param.get* object:

![4x4swap pic](resource/ps2j_rev_ctrl.png)

Invoke this patch with:

    pd2jack -p rev_ctrl.pd -n Reverb -a 2:2 -m 1:0 '1 90' '2 99' '3 0.7'

**Prerequisites** -- the Pd abstraction *param.get.pd* must be in the pd directory.

### What's happening...

This technique is used to pass Pd parameters in Pierre Guillot's **Camomile**, a cross-platform **Pure Data -> plugin API**. I *appropriated* the technique (and the abstraction) because it's simple & fast (and it's easy to use Camomile patches).

In short, the pair '1 90' would be sent to the patch in the form (internally):

    param 1 90
        or
    "param" <parameter#> <parameter_value>

Where the parameter# is the identifier used by *param.get.pd*, and the parameter_value is the value sent. The "param" string is the name used for Pd **send** & **receive** objects.

Of course, "param" is added by **pd2jack** and send to the patch with the rest. 

While the *param.get.pd* abstraction makes the process easy, in it's simplest form, think of it like this in the Pd patch (with three "number pairs" entered):

    [receive param]
    |
    [route 1 2 3]
     |   |   |
     |   |  [process value passed with 3]
     |  [process value passed with 2]
    [process value passed with 1]

YES, it would be trivial to add **named** send/receive pairs to this application. I.E., to replace the *parameter#* prefix with a custom parameter string, and send that to a named *receive* object in the patch.

## Compiliation and Installation

The *pd2jack* app is built on and requires **LibPd**. A **LibPd** build is dependent on a current **Pure Data** installation (source and build). The **Pure Data** distribution is a subdir in a **LibPd** install. **LibPd** and it's dependencies are a submodule of the *pd2jack* GIT.

As of the first "official" release *pd2jack* is currently statically-linked to the **LibPd** Library (libpd.a). This results in a larger executable, but as *LibPd* isn't widely available in a distro package format (deb, rpm, etc), it's the only way to distribute the project without building the dependencies from source (AFAIK, the library isn't pre-compiled for Ubuntu, for instance).

Building from source is a good idea, though. Here's how:

## Clone pd2jack

Create a folder where source and build will reside, then open a console and enter:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GModal/pd2jack.git

Cloning the project recursively will also clone the sources of **LibPd** and **Pure Data**.

## Build and install pd2jack

A simple *Makefile* is included. Open a console in the *pd2jack* build folder, and enter:

    make libpd
    make

**Optional**: the size of the executable can be reduced (by ~10%) by entering:

    strip pd2jack

And if it's to be installed system-wide:

    sudo make install
